## `dag_builder__random_dag`: https://www.loom.com/share/b85b2b27d1f54f9eabaa5024ebf5e15a

### run with:
python dag_builder__random_dag.py 5 40 True

### In this example case:
`num_levels` = 5
 - This is the depth of the DAG

`nodes` = 40
 - This is how many total SQL models will be built in your project

`skip_levels` = True
 - This is whether or not you want references to skip levels and be referenced from a model 2 levels downstream.

Example using this to test at which point dbt Cloud starts to have degraded performance with number of models:
